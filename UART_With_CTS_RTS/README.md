# Introduction

The idea of this application is to use the PMOD connector to allow the 
user to plugin in a TTL UART adapter that supports the RTS / CTS signals.
(RTS / CTS are also used by the Bluetooth PMOD that also communicates over UART
which is the PMOD that I am working towards).

# APIO Setup

```
apio init --board icestick
```
